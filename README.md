# New "Clean" Refactor Notes
In February 2022 I did a major refactor of this repo https://github.com/mitchtabian/Open-API-Android-App.
Here's what I did:
1. Add interface between UseCases and concrete data source (cache/network/datastore).
1. Restructure packages.
1. Add rules to ViewModels to get best architecture.
1. ŸêClarification of fragment events.
